### Session1: Introduction to Linux

#### What am I about to learn?

Today's lab session is essential to have a solid start with cloud deployments. Make sure you complete all the tasks before the next class.

Lab 1 part 1 focuses on how to:

**Lab 1.1 Part A**    Connect to your Virtual Machine (VM) in the Google Cloud Platform.

**Lab 1.1 Part B**    Learn how to run Linux commands using the command-line interface.



#### How to best approach the tutorials?

The labs are in the form of a complete step by step tutorial that you need to follow.

- Take your time and watch the videos of redeeming your coupon, creating a VM, and connecting using Visual Studio Code. Lab 1 exercise is an excellent way to assess the necessary skills required in this module.

- Do not just copy and paste the commands but try to understand the steps by typing in the commands.

- Developers who understand the command line would argue it's one of the best tools at your disposal. Understanding the use of the CLI and memorising basic commands are vital skills for every computer scientist. 

- Do not worry if you don't remember everything after the first class; we will have the opportunity to work with these commands again and again in the next ten weeks.

- I suggest you create an online logbook (e.g., a GitHub page) to keep notes of the essential commands.

- Do not be afraid to try the commands, again and again, to get used to them. Commands that could be potentially harmful (for example, delete a user etc.) will be highlighted during this lab.

  

####  Do you want to explore more the Linux command-line interface?

Download the [Linux Pocket Guide](https://www.dropbox.com/s/roe59y2gyghyq7b/Linux Pocket Guide%2C 3rd Edition.pdf?dl=0) and explore the commands. 

Do not copy and paste the commands as copying from this document and pasting into the terminal could turn text into gibberish (e.g. quotation marks etc.).



#### Part A: Preparing your workspace

You will need to watch the videos posted in preparation for the first class to run this tutorial.

1. Firstly, watch the following video configuring GCP to create a new Virtual Machine (VM).

> You should be able now to create a new VM :white_check_mark:

2. Then, watch the following video configuring Visual Studio Code (VSC) and connecting to the GCP VM.

> You should be able now to connect using VSC :white_check_mark:

> :rotating_light: If you move keys in another computer, you might need to adjust the permissions; if so, run the following command in the keys folder.

```
$ chmod 400 *  
```
